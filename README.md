# About this repo

This repo holds all the react challenges made by Scotch.io on their 10 React Challenges.
I was able to do all, except for the last one.

All the challenges are inside the folder **./src**
To run the challenges, inside **src/index.js**,

````
ReactDOM.render(<Day9 />, rootElement);
````
Switch **<Day9 />** , which is a component, to the correspondent challenge you want to run.


# Installing and running


Basic react project with no other dependencies except the ones that react itself needs.

```` yarn install/ npm i ````

```` yarn start/ npm start ````
